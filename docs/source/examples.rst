Examples
========

Three examples of how the software can be used are in the folder
``docs/examples``.


Jupyter Notebook
----------------

For a given system, the first two show how to obtain the outflows,
probability of water shortage, life cycle cost and many other results:

`basic usage example <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tylunel/pvpumpingsystem/blob/master/docs/examples/simulation_tunis_basic.ipynb>`_

`more advanced usage example <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tylunel/pvpumpingsystem/blob/master/docs/examples/simulation_tunis_advanced.ipynb>`_


The third shows how to optimize the selection of one or more component
on the pumping station based on user requirements.

`sizing example <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tylunel/pvpumpingsystem/blob/master/docs/examples/sizing_example.ipynb>`_

Previous examples can be run in binder as well by clicking on the
corresponding icon in the upper right-hand corner of nbviewer pages, or by
accessing through the
`binder build <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tylunel/pvpumpingsystem/master>`_.


Python files
------------
These examples are also available in the form of python files in order to
freely adapt the code to your needs. Directly check out in ``docs/examples``.
