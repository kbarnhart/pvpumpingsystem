Package Overview
================

Introduction
------------

Scope
^^^^^
*Pvpumpingsystem* is an open source package providing various tools aimed
at facilitating the modeling and sizing of photovoltaic powered water
pumping systems.

This package helps users to model, test and validate different photovoltaic
pumping systems before actually installing it in situ. In order to guide the
user in her/his choice, *pvpumpingsystem* provides both technical and financial
information on the system.

It models pumping systems minimally made of PV generator, DC motor-pump and
pipes. Each component can be precisely defined by the user in such a way
it corresponds closely to any actual system wanted.
User can choose to add a MPPT/DC-DC converter to increase the energy
yield of the PV array or to directly couple PV array and motor-pump.
The software also allows to add water tank to mitigate the effect of
intermittency.
The simulation eventually compute numerous outputs like hourly flow rates of
a given pump, efficiencies of components, risk of water shortage and
life cycle cost of the whole system.


*Pvpumpingsystem* also offers to automate the process of sizing. In this case,
the user can provide a set of PV module, a set of motor-pumps and a
water needs file, and the software looks for the cheapest assembly while
making sure that it respects a minimum risk of water shortage.

Nevertheless, the number of sizing processes can be infinite, and this module
is expected to significantly expand with time, welcoming new sizing process
based on different selection criteria or algorithms.


To better understand the possibilities of *pvpumpingsystem* and how it works,
you are invited to consult the Jupyter Notebook examples available in
``docs/examples``.



Code characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python is the programming language used in the software, and the code is
structured within an object-oriented approach. Continuous integration
services allow checking for lint in the code and to automatize the tests.
Each class and function are documented in the docstring with reference to the
literature when applicable.

Pvpumpingsystem relies on already existing packages for photovoltaic
and fluid mechanics modeling, namely *pvlib-python* and *fluids*.
*pvpumpingsystem*'s originality lies in the implementation of various
motor-pump models for finite power sources and in the coupling
of the distinct component models.

Pvpumpingsystem is released under a GPL-v3 license.
