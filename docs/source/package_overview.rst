Package Overview
================

Introduction
------------

Pvpumpingsystem is an open source package providing various tools aimed 
at facilitating the modeling and the sizing of photovoltaic powered water 
pumping systems. Even though the package is originally targeted at researchers 
and engineers, two practical examples are provided in order to help anyone 
to use pvpumpingsystem.

Python is the programming language used in the software, and the code is 
structured within an object-oriented approach. Continuous integration 
services allow checking for lint in the code and to automatize the tests. 
Each class and function are documented with reference to the 
literature when applicable. 

Pvpumpingsystem is released under a GPL-v3 license.

Pvpumpingsystem relies on already existing packages for photovoltaic 
and fluid mechanics modeling, namely *pvlib-python* and *fluids*. 
*pvpumpingsystem*'s originality lies in the implementation of various 
motor-pump models for finite power sources and in the coupling 
of the distinct component models.
